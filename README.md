## What is OpSec?

OpSec, short for Operational Security, is like locking your digital doors to keep your online activities safe and private. Think of it as securing your secrets on the internet, shielding you from online risks.

### Operational Security (OpSec): The First Step

- OpSec guards your online identity, adding a layer of protection.
- It's not a magic cloak of invisibility, but it enhances your digital security.

### Understanding Limitations

- OpSec won’t make you anonymous; it minimizes risks.
- Your online actions can leave traces, so use OpSec wisely.

### Stay Mindful of Personal Information

- Be cautious about sharing sensitive details.
- Limit personal info online to avoid being “doxed.”

### Social Media Awareness

- Check privacy settings on social platforms.
- Avoid oversharing; control what curtains are open in your digital house.

### Secure Your Accounts

- Use strong, unique passwords for each account.
- Enable two-factor authentication for an extra layer of security.

### Browsing Safely

- Use HTTPS websites for secure connections.
- Be cautious with public Wi-Fi; not everyone should hear your digital conversations.

### Be Skeptical of Strangers

- Online, not everyone is who they seem to be.
- Avoid sharing too much with people you don’t know well.

### Regular Checkups

- Periodically review your online presence.
- Update passwords, review privacy settings, and make adjustments as needed.

### Educate Yourself

- Stay informed about new online threats; knowledge is your digital armor.
